CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password: EECS4481-Project-T5/server-app/server.js:25
Details: <span>This variable assignment uses a hard-coded password that may compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.  The use of a hard-coded password significantly increases the possibility that the account being protected will be compromised.  Moreover, the password cannot be changed without patching the software.  If a hard-coded password is compromised in a commercial product, all deployed instances may be vulnerable to attack.  In some cases, this finding may indicate a reference to a password (e.g. the name of a key in a properties file) rather than an actual password. set</span> <span>Store passwords out-of-band from the application code.  Follow best practices for protecting credentials stored in locations such as configuration or properties files. An HSM may be appropriate for particularly sensitive credentials.</span> <span>References: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html">CWE</a></span>
